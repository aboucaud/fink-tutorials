# Fink workshop, 6 February 2020 @ IJCLab

Welcome to the first Fink Workshop!

**Goals for the workshop**

This first Fink workshop contains short presentations about the status of the Fink project and its roadmap until the full proposal submission (15/06/2020). There are also tutorials to explore ZTF alert data and Fink tools. More specifically, participants will learn what is an alert and what it contains, how to connect to Fink streams, build a Fink filter, a Fink science module, and interface external alert streams to Fink.

**Before starting**

Participants are expected to work from an Unix machine (mac/linux), with python3 installed (we recommend Anaconda). We cannot guarantee tutorials will work on Windows. Participants need an Internet connection: **eduroam should be available on the room, so make sure you get an account before the workshop!**

## How to reach the room

The workshop will be held at **IJCLab (ex-LAL, building 200), room 101**. IJCLab is a laboratory situated on the Orsay Campus, 30km south from Paris center.

- From Paris to Orsay: From Paris center, take the `RER B` southward (`Saint-Rémy-Lès-Chevreuse` direction). Stop at `Orsay-ville` station.
- From Orsay RER station to IJCLab: [Google Maps direction](https://goo.gl/maps/BpdAiKeU9gpzGJkx9). It is a 15min walk inside the campus. Ask for LAL or building 200 if you are lost.
- In IJCLab: Enter the building (you might have to ring), and turn right. Pass 3 doors until you find a stairway on your left. Climb the stairs and the `room 101` is located at the top of the stairs on the right.
